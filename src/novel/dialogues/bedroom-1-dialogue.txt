You /Another sleepless night. <br> These nightmares have kept me awake for a long time.
You /Lately all I can do is complain about it. <br> Maybe I should be more concerned and take some pills.
You /Despite my insomnia I still have a lot of things to take care today.
/You get up from bed and got dressed
You /I hope there is no problem to be in school since the early morning.
